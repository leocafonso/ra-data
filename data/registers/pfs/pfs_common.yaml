# Generic PFS - Pin Function Select Register
# This is a simplified template for PFS registers.
# Each chip has different available pins, but the register structure is similar.
#
# PFS registers are 32-bit with 3 access modes:
# - Full 32-bit access (PFS)
# - 16-bit half access (PFS_HA) at offset +2
# - 8-bit byte access (PFS_BY) at offset +3
#
# The actual pin registers are defined per-chip since available pins vary.

  items: []  # Registers are per-pin and defined by chip data
